While the Survey123 team still looks from time to time to this Github repo, we have moved into the [Survey123 GeoNet Group](https://geonet.esri.com/groups/survey123). In there you will find:
- A User Forum where you can ask technical questions and report  issues. We do our best to monitor activity daily.
- A [Blog](https://geonet.esri.com/groups/survey123/blog) with lots of information about  using Survey123. 

We keep this repo around because a ton of info that we do not want to lose and also because some people still come back here to report issues. Again, we still look into this repo, but if you want decent response times it is best  you use the [Survey123 GeoNet Group](https://geonet.esri.com/groups/survey123)
