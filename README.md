Survey123 (Build 0.0.42)

Favorites:
Mark a set of answers as a favorite using the menu on the top right of the survey form. Once you have a favorite, use the same menu to paste the answers into a new survey. If you have already provided answers, they will not be overwritten by the paste. Your favorite survey will be saved in your Review list.

Submitted Surveys:
Submitted surveys are now automatically deleted from your device (unless they are set as the favorite).

Survey123 Connect (Build 0.0.39)

Defaults:
Use the default column in your spreadsheets to define the default values for your survey questions. Use today() in date fields to default to today's date. Use a comma separated list for more than one default value for multiple_select fields.

Required Fields:
Put a value of 'yes' in the required fields column of your spreadsheet to ensure a question is answered before it is submitted. If required fields are empty, the survey can only be saved as a draft, not completed.
